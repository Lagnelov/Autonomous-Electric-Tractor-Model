# Autonomous-Electric-Tractor-Model

This model simulates the machine work for an agricultural tractor during one season/year. 

It is a dynamic, discrete-event model with state based logic. It requires MATLAB to run and includes the model file, a m-file where all the inputs and model configurations are defined, and a file detailing the rainfall volumes for 30 years of Swedish weather. 


The system limits is at the interface between charging/refuelling points and farm. It focuses on the machine operations and energy requirements from the machine to the soils. 
The model includes parameters to run any number of tractors of any size and with battery-electric, diesel or fuel-cell-hydrogen drives. 

The model is explained in the following publications: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.03.017 

The impact of vehicle weight on the model is explained in the following publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atech.2022.100156
